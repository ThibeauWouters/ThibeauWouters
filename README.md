I am a PhD student at [Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/en) and affiliated with the Dutch National Institute for Subatomic Physics, [Nikhef](https://www.nikhef.nl/en/).
In my research, I work on Bayesian data analysis tools for gravitational waves and multi-messenger astrophysics.
In particular, I focus on robustly inferring the equation of state of neutron stars from nuclear physics and, e.g., gravitational waves emitted by binary neutron star mergers.
I build a lot of software on top of [JAX](https://github.com/jax-ml/jax/) and like to run code on GPUs.

Here is a list of packages I often contribute to
- [jester](https://github.com/nuclear-multimessenger-astronomy/jester/): A JAX-based package for fast inference of the nuclear equation of state from neutron star data ![jester](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/nuclear-multimessenger-astronomy/jester?style=social)
