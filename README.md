I am a PhD student at [Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/en) and affiliated with the Dutch National Institute for Subatomic Physics, [Nikhef](https://www.nikhef.nl/en/). In my research, I work on Bayesian data analysis tools for gravitational waves and multi-messenger astrophysics, building fun applications with [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax). Here's a sample of some packages I am currently working on/with:

- [ripple](https://github.com/tedwards2412/ripple/): Differentiable gravitational waveforms with JAX ![ripple](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/tedwards2412/ripple?style=social)
- [fiesta](https://github.com/ThibeauWouters/fiesta/): Fast inference of electromagnetic signals with JAX ![fiesta](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/ThibeauWouters/fiesta?style=social)
- [jim](https://github.com/kazewong/jim/): Gravitational-wave data analysis tools in JAX ![jim](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/kazewong/jim?style=social)
- [flowMC](https://github.com/kazewong/flowMC/): Normalizing-flow enhanced sampling package for probabilistic inference in JAX ![jim](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/kazewong/flowMC?style=social)
- [jose](https://github.com/tsunhopang/jose/): A JAX-based TOV solver ![jose](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/tsunhopang/jose?style=social)
